# Hey there, I'm Wassim 👋

A passionate software engineer with many years of professional experience. I have worked for various start-ups developing back-end and front-end systems. Over time, I developed a passion for trust-less computing, DLTs and blockchain technology. Working on Blockchain projects is a way for me to contribute to a more open, trust-less and verifiable web. 🚀

## What I Do

I’m passionate by the idea of a Web3 cloud—a decentralized, trustless infrastructure where interoperability and shared security redefine how data and value move. With innovations like the transformative JAM protocol, as detailed in its gray paper, we’re laying the groundwork for a resilient, open, and truly global network that empowers individuals and dismantles centralized gatekeepers.

## Current Adventures

Right now, I'm diving deep into the Polkadot ecosystem, contributing to innovative projects that are reshaping the web:

- **[JAMIXIR](https://github.com/jamixir)**: An Elixir implementation of the JAM protocol, bringing the power of trust-less computing to the Elixir community. 🔥
- **[ScholarLedger](https://github.com/ScholarLedger)**: a blockchain-based platform designed to support the peer review process for academic institutions. 🏫

## Fun Stats & Tidbits

- **Years in Software Development:** 10+ years  
- **Tech Stacks:** Elixir, Rust, TypeScript, and more...
- **Text Editor:** Doom Emacs, of course! 😈
- **Favorite Emoji:** 🔐 (because secure, trust-less computing is my jam!)  
- **Philosophy:** Code should empower, not obscure. I strive to build systems that are as transparent as they are powerful.
