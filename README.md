# Hey there, I'm Wassim 👋

A passionate software engineer with many years of professional experience. I have worked for various start-ups developing back-end and front-end systems. Over time, I developed a passion for trust-less computing, DLTs and blockchain technology. Working on Web3 projects is a way for me to contribute to a more open, trust-less and verifiable web. 🚀

**By the way, I'm a proud Polkadot Blockchain Academy Lucerne (2025 Protocol track) alumni.**

## Current Adventures

Right now, I'm diving deep into the Rust ecosystem, trying to get my hands dirty learning and implementing things:

- **[Algorithms and Data Structures in Rust](https://github.com/wassimans/algorithms-and-data-structures-in-rust)**

At the same time, I'm trying to get invloved into the Polakdot SDK ecosystem to start contributing.

## Fun Stats & Tidbits

- **Years in Software Development:** 10+ years  
- **Tech Stacks:** Elixir, Rust, TypeScript, and more...
- **Text Editor:** Doom Emacs, of course! 😈
- **Favorite Emoji:** 🔐 (because secure, trust-less computing is my jam!)  
- **Philosophy:** Code should empower, not obscure. I strive to build systems that are as transparent as they are powerful.
